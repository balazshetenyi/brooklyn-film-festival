Responsive web site using Bootstrap


Project to-dos:

1. Website prototype
You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. It should not be hosted online.
